# CustomerFeedbackDataset

** A Data Analysis Project performed on Python & TABLEAU in my journey into Data Science.** 

Data set can be found on the KAGGLE website here -> <code>[Customer Feedback Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishweshsalodkar/customer-feedback-dataset)</code> :hourglass:

### About Project 👨‍💻

- This dataset contains customer sentiments expressed in various sources such as social media, review platforms, testimonials, and more. The dataset includes text, sentiment (positive or negative), source of the sentiment, date/time of the sentiment, user ID, location, and confidence score. The sentiments reflect customers' opinions and experiences with products, services, movies, music, books, restaurants, websites, customer support, and more.
- Will be using Python to Transform and clean the data. 
- Will be using TABLEAU to create a dashboard for visualization. My TABLEAU can be found here -> <code>[TABLEAU Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/francisco.de.anda)</code>
